# KiCad Propgataion Delay Tool
This project aims to provide a tool that can calculate propagation delay easily in KiCad for high speed digital designs.

The current scope of the project is:
  1. Create a Python CLI that can easily be integrated into other projects
  2. Accurate approximation of propagation delay
  3. KiCad IPC

The scope of the project will gradually increase, end goal being a easy to integrate CLI tool and KiCad integration.
